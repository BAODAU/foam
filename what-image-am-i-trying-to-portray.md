# What image am I trying to portray

So I just realized. Instead of being myself, I conjure up a charming personality that I believe to be impressive to people and act on it. That is not my truth. A happy-go-around person. 
Un-self-conscious? Am I trying to portray to people that I am so entranced with reality that I surrender myself to the eternal present? I am incapable of seeing the future? Anti-social behavior?

## How people think of me 
Dunno.
