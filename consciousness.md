## Mindset
You can have the most status and be the best. 

Our lives tend to be a series of outputs for whatever inputs we recieve. Shape our influencers.

If you want to fuck the girl, you want to hang out with all the popular kids that fuck girls all the time. 

"Work hard" is shit advice. The most money cones from having an amzing day, lifting your heart out, fucking the girl of your dreams, and then sitting down with a cup of coffee. Strategizing, planning, thinking on as high of a level as you can. Then spend 20 minutes making the calls to execute it. 

Start picking your influencers. 
## Be sober
A sober man attracts all kinds of people, from classy to other people who desire to quit. 
## Don't be mindless
