# Loneliness

## Problems

1. Level of vulnerability to social disconnection
2. ability to self-regilate the emotions associated with feeling isolated
3. mental representations and expectations of others
When loneliness takes hold, the ways we see ourselves and others are heavily influenced by both our feelings of unhappiness and threat and our impared ability to self-regulate. 

Some people's personal need for inclusion or sensitivity to exclusion is low enough that the ycan tolerate moving away from friends or family without too much distress. 

## A condition that does not improve with age.

 Just like young poeple made to feel disconnected in the moment, older adults who felt lonely in their daily lives had a substantially higher intake of fatty foods. 

People who feel lonely know better than to gorge on ince creame, berate co-workers, sleep around, or yell at their husband for bringing home the wrong kind of jelly. 

Lonely individuals are just as socially skilled as the others. In the conditions of real life, as opposed to experimental conditions when we are asked to play a certain role, loneliness prevents us from putting that ability to good use. Despite their display of skills in the experiment, the lonely participants consistently rated themselves as being less socially adept than other people. 

If you perceive that others see you as worthless, you are more likely to engage in self-destructive behaviors and less likely to take good care of yourself. 

This stress in the lives of the lonely may be compunded by a tendency to be trapped in frustrating jobs. Because of their problematic social responses, people who get stuck in loneliness are less likely to get the top spot. 

While a manageable level of stress can strengthen, motivate, and keep us on our toes, while we feel lonely, they are far less likely to see any given stressor as an invigorating challenge. 

Loneliness may damage the cardiovascular by promoting passive coping in the face of stress.
