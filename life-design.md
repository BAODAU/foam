# Life Design

## Dysfunctional belief
1. Your degree determines your career. 
> Three-quarters of all college grads don't end up working in a career related to their majors. 
2. If you are successful, you will be happy
> True happiness comes from desigining a life that works for you. 
3. It's too late
> It's never too late to design a life you love. 
4. I need to find my passion
5. I should know where I'm going!
> I won't always know where I'm going - but I can always know whether I'm going in the right direction.
6. Work is not supposed to be enjoyable; that's why they call it work
7. I have to find the right one idea
> I need a lot of ideas so that I can explore any number of possibilities for my future


> Enjoyment is a guide to finding the right work 

## Definition
A well-designed life is a life that is generative: it is constantly creative, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise. 

A well-designed life is a life that makes sense. It's a life in which who you are, what you believe, and what you do all line up together. A well-designed life is a portfolio of experiences, of adventures, of failures that taught you important lessons, of hardships that made you stronger and helped you know yourself better. 

We spend most of the hours of our days and the days of our lives at work. Work can be a daily source of enormous joy and meaning, or it can be an endless grind and waste of hours spent trying to get our way through the misery of it all until the weekend comes. A well-designed life is not a life of drudgery. 

## Passion
Passion comes after we try something, discover we like it and develop mastery. 


## Start where you are
We've got problems. 
If it's not actionable, it's not a problem. People fight reality. They fight it tooth and nail, with everything they've got. 

### gravity problems
They exist and you can't fix them.

two variations of gravity problems: totally inactionable and functionally unactionable.

The key is not to get stuck on something that you have effectively no chance of succeeding at. The only response to a gravity problem is acceptance. 

### Areas
#### Health
It pays to be healthy: emotionally, physically, and mentally. The relative importance of each of these is up to you. 
#### Work
Stuff you do, not strictly monetary. 
#### Play
Activity that brings you joy. 
#### Love
You have to pay attention to it. 

### My current situation
As we said, healthy to us means being well in more than just your body; you might want to take into account your mind and spirit, too. The relative importance of each area is entirely up to you. Make a quick assessment of your health and then fill in your gaugeâ€”are you a quarter full, or half, or three-quarters, or really full? (Bill has also filled in the gauges for his dashboard as an example to reference.)

#### Health
I'm in good physical health. I might not be in a good mental position since my mind often wanders off and I suspect I might have an intense tendency to deny the present moment. I do have bad sleep hygiene and screen time. I tried to do journal. If I were to improve my health I can join a group promoting mental and spiritual health.

#### Work
I am currently a college drop-out so there is no 'official' work for me to do. I am in a tight budget situation but I am still not working even minimum wage jobs so this area of my life is severely lacking and my be the reason why I am so unhappy. I justify it by saying that I read books and do exercises. 
I would rate this area in my life a 0. 

#### Play
I'm not doing anything that brings me joy. Reading has recently become something more of a chore since I stopped treating reading as a coping mechanism. 
0
#### Love
My parents are still alive but they are going into retirement. I haven't been in frequent contact with them since I embarked on this solo journey. I often tell myself that I would some day reconnect with them with the same intensity but god life will pass me by quickly and my parents will die. My dad will probably die first since he is out of shape and is really stressed out. My friends situation is not any better. I stopped talking to a lot of my friends. I also realized I have a very bad habit of not continuing communication.

## Workview reflection
Work! It's a word I used to dread, and still do. It implies a sense of responsibility, of giving myself, my time, my contributions to the world. When I leaned heavily toward nihilism, I used to think work is nothing more than noises to fill the void of meaningless inside my heart. Now that I see that worldview doesn't help me show to the world what kind of person I am, doesn't help me get closer to living the beautiful lives that I have been looking up to. 

Work should be a means to get closer to the position I want to be in life. Work should also be life itself. It should not be a form of denial of my life. I mean the kind of work that I dread going to, the kind of work that I spend the majority working and hating it. Work should always push me to push myself. For work to be meaningful, I am convinced that it should alleviate human suffering and not add more to it. If it doesn't help people out there, at least it should make me happier. 

I believe in the fundamentals of capitalism. That I will be propotionally rewarded for the amount of effort I put in if I work for the force that fuels economy itself. That means money should come once I understand what underlies capitalism: excessive consumption and spiritual redemption. With that said, for someone who is a virgin in the workforce. My opinion doesn't matter. 

Work should also be a reciprocal relationship. I give in my effort to an organization and I should take something out of it. For the work to be meaningful, I have to put in real effort and get rewarded with growth. Work, to my understanding, often rewards people with technical acuity. I want to get a job that rewards me with money, spiritual growth, and inner peace. The kind of work that I make a lot of money but I still can sleep peacefully at night knowing I helped the world to be a better place. Work that doesn't push me to the edge that I might have severe ties with other aspects of my life. Work that I wake up to every morning with a sense of excitement and peace knowing that I am living true to who I am. Right now I might be in no position to dream of such work but god do I love to be the man I want to be. 

Work should not be a chore. Something I do to keep the status quo. It should be an evergiving gift that rewards me propotionally for the effort I put in.

## Lifeview reflection
What do I know about life? Not a single bit. I might know how different people think about it. Viktor Frankl might tell us that life's meaning is whatever we give meaning to it. 

But for me, man I'm kinda sinking deep into nihilism. We as humans are here for no reason at all. We can do things and stuff to survive but ultimately there is not really a purpose behind our survival. See, I will give a meaning to life right now. It is to happy and spread my happiness to other people around me.

The purpose of life is to be happy, content and help others feel happy and content. I as a human being should do my best to be the best version of myself and spread that awesomeness around. Yet it shouldn't be a solo game. 

Good is things that work in harmony with the law of nature and help alleviate pain. Evil is inflicting unnecessary pain. Simple worldview because I don't really understand how the world works. There might be a higher power, something that explains what this whole thing is about. What impact does this transcedent entity have on my life is negligible. It doesn't stop me from making bad decisions and guiding me toward making good ones. 

All the emotions in life are ways of knowing whether I'm living in harmony with myself. They can be results of different thinking patterns. If I believe that inflicting unnecessary pain is bad but still do it just for the sake of doing it, I should feel remorse or at least guilt. If I don't feel guilt I might feel guilty for feeling guilty. Anyway, if my mind and emotions are functional, I should be able to use these emotions as tools to help me understand where I am standing with my moral compass. 

## Coherency between workview-lifeview
a. Where do your views on work and life complement one another?
I believe life is about giving. 

b. Where do they clash?

c. Does one drive the other? How?

## Finding my way
There's no one destination in life. You can't put your goal into your GPS and get the turn-by-turn directions for how to get there. The first clues are engagement and energy. 

### Engagement 
Try to write down when you feel excited. 

Log when I am and am not engaged and energized will help me pay attention to what I'm doing and discover what's working.

My job is to drill down into the particulars of my day and catch myself in the act of having a good time. 

## Philosophies
1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from
2. You never choose your first solution to any problem. 

Don't make a doable problem into an anchor problem by wedding yourself to a solution that isn't working. 

Sometimes it is more comfortable to hold on to our familiar, failed approach to the problem than to risk a worse failure. So the way forward is to redice the risk of failure by designing a series of small prototypes to test the waters.

It is okay for prototypes to fail but well-designed prototypes teach you something about the future.
