## Correctness
Without a proof of correctness, an algorithm while I think might be reasonable, could be wrong. 

## Technique
An important and honorable technique in algorithm desig is to narrow the set of allowable instances until there is a correct and efficient algorithm. 

Example: we can restrict a graph problem from general graphs down to trees, or a geometric problem from two dimensions down to one. 

## Modeling the problem
The art of formulating my application in terms of well-understood problems. 
Most algs are designed to work on rigorously defined abstract structures such as permutations, graphs, and sets. 

### Trees
Represent hierarchical relationships between items. Trees are likely the object in question if the problem deals with 'hierarchy', 'dominance relationship', 'ancestor/descendant relationship', or 'taxonomy'
### Graphs 
Represent relationship between arbitrary pairs of objects. Graphs
