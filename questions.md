### Questions
1. Do you want to hang out with the Vietnamese group? 
Yes. But more often than not I can't. So as a defense mechanism I will pretend like I don't need them. 
2. Does it matter that you can't hang out with them? 
No, because I can always go and make a new friend group. Could be my ego speaking, but I am very good at knowing people. Making friends whom I feel comfortable sharing my feelings with? Hard. I have to work on myself for this.
