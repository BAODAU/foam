A single molecule: dopamine is responsible for our motivation. 

Dopamine is increased in anticipation of sex and consummation. 

Whether we have a desire to overcome barriers. It lies in the center of important things in life. The way you conceptualize your goal determines how you reach it. 

Understand how dopamine works can help you leverage it to achieve your goal. If you don't, there's a good chance the world could pull you out of your grind. 

### Structure
Building block for epinephrine. 

### Motivation = Pleasure + Pain 
Balancing pleasure and pain. It is released in the brain. If you can internalize it in the brain. When you are sitting around, this reward pathway is releasing dopamine at a baseline rate. When you get excited, (anticipation for something), a higher rate of dopamine is released. 

**Sex:** releases dopamine, it increases dopamine of about 100%. Cocaine and emphetamine increases your dopamine 1000x. 

### Novelty
Increases dopamine. Drugs. New partners. 

When you anticipate something, the amount of dopamine increases. 

One practice of mediataion: eat one almond and really focuses on the experience of eating that almond. The texture, the taste of it. Mindfulness. It gives you. 

People hyper-dopaminergic. There are people who have.  

Passive manipulation is the best way to maneuver. Dopamine only cares if you reach your goal. 

### Two kinds of procrastinators
The first. Super-oxygenation breathing: increases low-level stress. You will be able to work and feel better. You can also ingest coffee. Consume more red meat. Increase motivation in the short term coupled with a crash. 

The other kind. They are not releasing enough dopamine. Take drugs to increase dopamine and epinephrine. 

The pain of lack of accomplishments will also increase. Dopamine is motivation for pleasure. Low levels of dopamine is less motivated. 

## The balance
### The intermittent reinforcement schedule
As you reach toward your goals. You have to blunt the reward. To not go and celebrate. Big increases in dopamine result in big crashes. 

Most of the learning tools are about rewards.
