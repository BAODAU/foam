# How to learn
## Make it stick 

Rereading text and massed practice is the least productive learning strategy. 

Elaborate: giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know. 

Mastery requires both the possession of ready knowledge and the conceptual understanding of how to use it. 

A great deal of what we think we know about how to learn is taken on faith and based on intuition but does not hold up under empirical research

Learn better and remember longer:

1. various forms of retrieval practice
2. lowstakes quizzing, self-testing andspacing out practice
3. try to solve a problem before being taught the solution

Reflection is a form of practice. 

Effortful retrieval makes for stronger learning and retention. After an initial test, delaying subsequent retrieval is more potent.  Practice testing knowledge yields better grasp of how far ahead we are with learning materials.

Interleaved retrieval helps you learn differentiation skills. It's important to not study mindlessly. The more active work you put into dwelling in the unknown, the better your chance of learning how to apply the new knowledge to existing knowledgebase. 

Embrace difficulty. Embrace a growth mindset, practice like an expert, construct memory cues.
