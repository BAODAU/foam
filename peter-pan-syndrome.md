# Peter Pan Syndrome
summarize: some useful ideas, overall a meme experience. 
## Anxiety
PPS victims are filled with anxiety. The cause of this free-floating anxiety is parental unhappiness. Parents of PPS victims are dissatisfied with their marriage and themselves. Reasons: lack of emotional warmth and sharing, an imalance in work and play, poor self-discipline, and an upheaval of traditional roles and values. Dad camouflages his pain with the tough-guy image. 

Mom tries to suffer in silence but fails. She feings satisfaction at the prospects of sacrificing her life the children.  The son perceives the isolation and distress. So he blames himself, figuring that his mother has good reason to reject him. 

In most cases the parents pretend to be happy. They are afraid to confront their feelings and face the truth. They aren't terribly disturbed, just blandly miserable. So they put on false smiles and participate in forced and fitful family outings. 

To the casual observer, nothing is wrong with these families

## Loneliness
Families of PPS victims are too affluent for their own good. Affluence without restraints create a falling domino effect in the children. The value of work is the first to tumble as children take pleasure as a right rather than as an earned privillege. They search for group identity. 

**The stamped toward sameness tramples their spirit of freedom** and deprives them of what little self-confidence they have. They work so hard to avoid rejection that they have little or no time to enjoy the comfort of belonging. 

Loneliness is the worst problem in our country today. They deperately need friends; yet the more they struggle, the worse they feel. Loneliness and affluence go hand-in-hand. Children who don't appreciate the value of work don't have much of a chance to feel proud of their accomplishments. Without honest pride, they are more apt to be crushed by peer pressure than those whose day-to-day survival cannot be taken for granted. 

Farm boys have more opportunity to learn good work habits, which frustrate the growth of PPS. The PPS affects middle and upper class children. 

## Sex role conflict 
Political events and media strategy have thrust our male children into a monumental sex role conflict. 
##  Narcissism and chauvinism
Narcissism locks the young man inside his own fantasies and prohibits the personal growth that comes from meaningful relationships with other people. 

## A piratical lifestyle
Peter's alter ego is a pirate. Given enough time and space, Peter could become as heartless and uncaring as his nemesis Captain Hook. 

PPS victims are jolly, happy-go-lucky rogues. They have a penchant for uproarious laughter and a pint or two of whatever ale, and they are forever seeking to regale themselves with a bevy of lovely wenches. 

They are capable of unconscionable foul deeds and can sing and dance as they are stealing your life's treasures. If they feel you have wronged them, they can call an instant rage to run you aground or skewer your heart with a promise and a lie. They'll cross into your territorial waters and take insult from your displeasure. Cross them a second time and they'll make your soul walk the plank. After pillaging your trust and concern, they will sail off into the sunset pretending to have neither worry nor care.

Conspicuous is the absence of personal accountability. He's a modern-day pirate cast adrift on a sea of loneliness. 

## 
They cry for attention, but when you give it, they snicker at the folly of your caring. Older victims have insight into their condition, but steadfastly refuse to seek or profit from help. You will empathize with the frustration. You don't know whether to hug 'em or hit 'em. 

He professes to be an accomplished heterosexual but feels very inadequate around women. The victim won't admit to sponging off his parents after he should be making a life of his own. He isn't willing to talk about his loneliness and irresponsibility. The prognosis is not good. 

For with all their rage, denial, and procrastination, the lives of PPS victims are filled with sadness. If they become dropous, they grow into adults whose never land turns into a prison which escape is almost impossible. In this prison they are ravaged by loneliness but pretend to have friends, they are trapped in self-doubt but pretend to be confident, they scream for happiness and pretend to be gay; they are consumed by isolation and pretend they are loved. The victims of PPS are alone, terribly alone. 


### What am I thinking about? 
There's a cyclic nature on my outlook on life. I vacillate between a manic excitement about the arrival of spring and a depressive despondency. 

It's the existential question: "Why am I here?" 

When the PPS victim sees a reason for his being, his excitement is infectious. When life holds no purpose, his depression is funereal. You feel like a yo-yo. One day you're up, the next day you are down. You long for stability. 

This is tied to the storm in his soul, He doesn't feel authentic just because he is alive. He feels that he must daily prove himslef to be a good person and worthy of being alive. When people like him, he feels good about himself and feels hope, even mania. When he faces failure or disapproval, he falsely concludes that his not good and not worthy of being alive. 

This should help you understand he surrounds himself with buddies, pushes himself to ridiculous extremes to be liked, takes the woman in his life for granted, rejects negative feelings about others, and flies into a rage when faced with criticism.

In their early years, we have an undying respect for the females in our lives. Extending kindness, demonstrating gracious manners, and offering a helping hand are common practices. It was sincere. It was deeply felt and honestly expressed.As conflicts sap the victims' ego, the fear of rejection deepens and this respect is adulterated by excessive devotion.

The resultant idolatry traps the victim into feelings of servitude. Anger is inevitable, so is rebellion. To shed himself of this contrived subservience. The victim adops an attitude of despisal toward the opposite sex, blaming them for his feelings of powerlessness.

He'll remain at a party, overstaying his welcome, just so that he doesn't miss a laugh. The answer is that through his uproarious laughter, he is attempting to drown out the voices of loneliness. The PPS victim feels very lonely, even in a crowd. In most cases he becomes accustomed to this estrangement and sees it as normal. 

A lover or wife feel sorry for the victim. 
> Why is he trying so hard? Why can't he just relax? Doesn't he know that other people will like him just the way he is?

Shortly after pubery, they face peer rejection and their inability to handle it. They begin to withdraw. They don't know how to protect themselves from the hurt, so they resort to avoidance of feelings. When they feel most vulnerable, they retreat to aloofness and indifference. This explain why the PPS victim adopts an "I don't care" attitude just about the tim he begins to feel sad or remorseful. 

You must comprehend the victim's narcissism. He is so deperate for recognition that he distorts reality by concluding that he clearly outranks all other men in desirability, and to deprive other women of the greatest man in the world is to run the risk of hurting them. 

### The pursuit of perfection 
The greater his insecurities, the more vivid the critical reflections and the stronger the need to project perfection. The attack of the projected insecurities is exacerbated by the absences of close friends and confidants. Years of anxiety and loneliness have cut him off from seeking refuge in people who really care about him. He sacrifices love for the safety of perfection. 

The victim pursues perfection with a compulsive fervor. But because he is woefully inept in many survival skills, he is unable to achieve perfection in any socially acceptable manner.

### Chauvinism 
Put her on a pedestal. Deify her humanity. Worship her divinity. Chauvinistic attitudes: men pretending they don't have feelings, weaknesses, or doubts about their egos. 

## Solve the problem 
### Communication prevent problems, but actions solve them 

### Many rules are negotiable, some are not
