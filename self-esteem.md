# Self Esteem
Observe the kind of issues involved in living consciously versus living unconsciously:
- thinking, even when thinking s difficult, versus nonthinking
- awareness
- clarity, whether or not it comes easily, versus obscurity or vagueness
- respect for reality, whether pleasant or painful, versus avoidance of reality
- respect for truth versus rejection of truth
- independence vs dependence
- active orientation vs passive orientation
- willingness to take appropriate risks vs unwillingness
- honesty with self vs dishonesty
- living in and being responsible vs retreting into fantasy
- self-confrontation vs self-avoidance
- willingness to see and correct mistakes vs perseverance in error
- reason vs irrationalism

One of the most important issues entailed in living consciously is intellectual independence. We can learn from one another, but real knowledge implies understanding, not mere repetition or imitation. 

There is a distinction between the psychology of those who try to understand things for themselves vs those now don't. 

Thinking independently - about our work, our relationship, the values that will guide our lives - is part of what is meant by living consciously. Indepedence is a self-esteem virtue. 


## There might be some homework to do

### Meditate on three areas with subpar consciousness
Meditate on what seems to difficult about staying in high-level mental focus in these areas. For each of these areas, write **The hard thing about staying fully conscious here is** as rapidly as possible, without censoring yourself. write 10 endings

Then do the same for **the good thing about not being fully conscious here ** . 

Then follow with **if i were to stay fully conscious here**

**Give some thoughts to tomorrow. And the next seven days of your life.** How can you apply these ideas to your daily concerns. 


#### personal belongings
The hard thing about staying fully conscioush here is that the worst case is I lose these things which I can easily buy back or get back. If I lose my stuff I can just spend some time looking for it and I will eventually get it. It's not like I have lost the most important stuff in my life anyway. The other hard thing about staying fully conscious on my personal belonging is the other attention-grabbing activities. If I get home the first thing I want is to go on a mindless scroll. So I have to throw stuff away as fast as possible in order to get comfy and start relaxing. I could say that this comes from my dopamine receptors being fucked beyond repair. Losing stuff and not finding them in time might fuck my schedule up and I have to do things less efficiently. 

The good thing about not being fully conscious here is that I trained my mind to be able to focus on more important issues at hand faster. If I don't pay enough attention to my belongings, as soon as I get down to work, I will work. 

If I were to stay fully conscious here, I can reduce a lot of time spent looking for stuff. I can spend more time being productive instead of being stressed out about little details. I might also get a sense of control from being able to manage the little details of my life. A better sense of control might enable me to do more important things. 

#### Mindless media consumption
The hard thing about staying fully conscious when I am on my bed is that I will get a feeling of total relaxation whenever I am on my bed. If I'm too excited I will numb myself down with some porn so that I can be sedated in bed. If I'm bored I will watch stupid videos that help ease me into sleep. This mindless video watching/binging comes from, first my insatiable dopamine crave, second my piss poor habits. It's very hard when the surrounding environment have been fostering this kind of environment for years. 

The good thing about mindless consumption is that I can use that to get closer to, or most of the time wayyy past my bedtime. I can sometimes come across interesting forums which would promote healthier lifestyle. 

If I were to stay fully conscious here, I will have to limit the cues to my media conscumption cravings. I should move all the electronics that I use for mindless consumption out of sight. Replacing them with stimulus for mindful consumption, i.e books, something else. Before that, I have to identify what are mindless consumption distractions so that I will not replace one vice with another. I gotta think for myself. 


#### money management
The hard thing about staying fully conscious with money is how many distractions out there that are used to steal away my attention. I know that with saving I can go on to do great things. Invest in the economy, invest in myself, help my relatives, etc. This requires a focus which I do not have normally. If I can make every decisions with the thoughts of future at the back of my mind, that could help me a lot. But that's not how human brains operate. We still have primate urges to focus on whatever in front of us and it takes discipline to see past the thin veil of capitalism.

One of the benefits of using money sonnambulistically is to impress our peers and stay relevant in our social cirlcles. These external validations may drive my internal fuel. I might work harder to level myself up. I might spend more time reflecting on social situations, thus making me more adept at navigating myself in social settings. I might be more confident, which will lead me to seek mentorship and be a better version of myself. This is a kind of fuel for pseudo-self-esteem. I mean it's so easy to say that those are all calculated purchases but that doesn't account for the fact that we buy stuff because other people buy them. 

If I were to stay fully conscious here. I have to make a budget and a plan that I can follow along that gives me both the serenity of mind and the monetary benefits. It will be restricting to the standard of living I am used to, but it will give me greater control and freedom in the long run. 

### With all of these information, what are you gonna do about it?
#### personal belongings
I will make a checklist of where things should be.  
#### mindless media consumption
I know for certain that putting limits on my device doesn't work. So I have to set up my environment so that I stop associating the kitchen with mindless browsing. Perhaps by following a new recipe every week. Read one practical blog/book about media consumption.
#### money
Be completely honest with myself about where I am with my money spending. Inform myself what level I am at. Put a personal finance book on my kindle. 

## Learning self-acceptance 
When the facts we must face have to do with ourselves, living consciosusly can suddenly become very difficult. This is the challenge of self-acceptance. 

Our self-esteem is not a function of our physical attractiveness. Rather our willingness or unwillingness to see and accept ourselves does have consequences for self-esteem.

### homework
Sometimes, looking back over my life, I can hardly believe that at one time I was too afraid to make the move I wanted to. There are a lot of cute girls that I want to talk to but for some reason I am scared of talking to them. One time I was so scared of looking into a girl's eyes that I tried to act cool and acted like I didn't care. I didn't accept the fact that I'm not a smooth dude and everything kinda comes awakwardly. I am very scared of confrontation. I can always muster up the courage to
