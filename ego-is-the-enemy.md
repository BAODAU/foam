# Ego Is the Enemy

## Phase 1: Aspiration
In this phase, you must practice seeing yourself with a little distance, cultivating the ability to get out of your own head.

It's easy to be emotionally invested with your own work. What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness. 

With their aggression, intensity, self-absoprtion, and endless self-promotion, our competitors don't realize how they jeopardize their own efforts.

**Myth:** self-assured genius. To whom doubt and introspection is foreign, as well as challenge the myth of pained, tortured artist who must sacrifice his health for his work. Nuh uh that ain't gonna work.

It's a temptation that exists for everyone: we replace action with talk and hype.

It's blank spaces, begging to be filled in with thoughts, with photos, with stories. Almost universally, the kind of performance we give on social media is *positive*

It's more "Let me tell you how well things are going. Look how great I am."

But the truth is "I'm scared. I'm struggling. I don't know." At the beginning of any path, we're excited and nervous. So we seek to comfort ourselves externally instead of inwardly.

**When overwhelmed by a project:** we do everything but focus on it. 

We seem to think that silence is a sign of weakness. That being ignored is equivalent to death (this is true for the ego)

That's what so insidious about talk. What is scarce and rare? Silence.

**Talk deletes us.** After a certain point our mind confuses talk with actual progress. The more difficult the task, the more uncertain the outcome, the more costly talk will be and the farther we run from actual accountability. Talking is almost like therapy. 

## To be or to do
> “Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road,” Boyd said to him. “And you’re going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go.” Using his hands to illustrate, Boyd marked off these two directions. “If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.” Then Boyd paused, to make the alternative clear. “Or,” he said, “you can go that way and you can do something—something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision.”

Whatever we seek to do in life, reality will intrude on our youthful idealism.

This kind of reality will redirect us from doing to being.

What is the ultimate choice that forces our hand? It is whether to be or to do.

If your purpose is something larger than yourself, then suddenly evrything becomes easier and more difficult. Easier in the sense that you know now what it is you need to do and what is important to you.

## Be a student
It is an extended period of instruction, it places the ego and ambition in someone else's hands. 

We don't like thinking that someone is better than us. Or that we have a lot left to learn. We want to be done. We want to be ready. We're busy and overburdened. The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents us from getting better.

A student is self-critical and self-motivated. You can't learn if you think you already know.

The art of taking feedback is such a crucial skill in life, particularly harsh and critical feedback. It tends to surprise people how humble aspiring greates have been. 

## Don't be passionate

**The reality:** we hear what we want to hear. We do what we feel like doing, and despite being busy and working very hard, we accomplish very little. Or worse, we find ourselves in a mess we never anticipated. 

Passion typically masks a weakness. Passion is seen in those who can tell you in great detail who they intend to become and what their success will be like: they might even be able to tell you when they intend to achieve it or descrive to you legitimate and sincere worries they have about the burdens of such accomplishments. They can tell you all the things they're going to do, but they cannot show you their progress.

How can someone be busy and not accomplish anything? That's the passion paradox. 
> Great passions are maladies without hope.

> Goethe

Passion is form over function. Purpose is function. The critical work that you want to do will require your deliberation and consideration. Not passion. Not naivete.

It'd be far better if you were intimidated by what lies ahead - humbled by its magnitude and determined to see it through regardless. **Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you are about and wish to be**

Remember Talleyrand's epigram: Surtout, pas trop de zele. (Most importantly, not too much zeal) Then you will do great things instead of being the good-intentioned but ineffective self.

## Follow the canvas strategy
When someone gets his first job or joins a new organization, he's told that 'make other people look good and you will do well.' Let's flip this around so it doesn't seem so demeaning: It's not about kissing ass. It's not about making someone look good. It's about providing the support so that others **can be** good. 

Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an *anteambulo.* Clear the path for the people above you and you will create a path for yourself. 

Facts: 
1. you are not nearly as good or as important as you think you are
2. you have an attitude that needs to be readjusted
3. most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong

There is one way to work all that out of your system: attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful and subsume your identity into theirs and move forward simultaneously.

Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you're the least important person in the room until you change that with results.

Be lesser and do more. Imagine for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them.And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefit them and not you.

Canvas strategy: helping yourself by helping others. Be a servant. Find what nobody wants to do and do it. Find inefficiencies and waste and redundancies. The person who clears the path control its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting. 

## Restrain yourself
> People who have accomplished the greatest results are those who 'keep under the body,' those who never grow excited or lose self-control, but are always calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite.

It doesn't matter how talented you are, how great your connections are, how much money you have. When you want to do something - something big and important and meaningful - you will be subjected to treatment ranging from indifference to outright sabotage. 

It doesn't degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them. The path to success would only tolerate restrain and have no forgiveness for ego. Facing opportunities to prove itself, my ego screams for me to indulge it. Instead, I must not do anything.

## Get out of your own head
> A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.

Fictional characters all have something in common: they can't get out of their own heads. How much better could we get if we manage to get out of our own head. Plato spoke of the type of people who are guilty of 'feasting on their own thoughts.'

It was common to find people who "instead of findind out how something desire might come about, they pass that over, so as to avoid tiring deliberations about what's possible. They assume that what they desire is available and proceed to arrange the rest, taking pleasure in thinking through everything they'll do when they have what they want, thereby making their lazy souls even lazier." They are real people preferring to live in passionate fiction than in actual reality. 

The novelist Anne Lamott describes ego story well. "If you are not careful, the station KFKD (K-Fucked) will play in your head 24/7, nonstop, in stereo."
> Out of the right speaker will come the endless stream of self-aggrandizement, the recitation of one's specialness, of how much more open and gifted and brilliant and knowing and misunderstood and humble one is. Out of the left speaker will be the rap songs of self-loathing, the lists of all the things one doesn't do well, of all the mistakes one has made today and over an entire lifetime, the doubt, the assertion that everything one touches turn to shit, that one doesn't do relationships well, that one is in every way a fraud, incapable of selfless love, that one had no talent or insight, and on and on. 

Anyone with ambitions can fall prey to this narration. Especially in a world that tells us to keep and promote a 'personal brand.' 

We are all full of anxieties, doubts, impotence, pains, and sometimes a little tinge of crazy. 

We are susceptible to this fantasy of people giving a shit about us as adults. We plug in some headphones and all of a sudden there's a soundtrack. We flip our jacket collar and consider how cool we must look. It's the opening credits montage. And so we stay stuck inside our heads instead of participating in the world around us. 

**What successful people do** is curb such flights of fancy. All of us are susceptible to these obsessions of the mind. The more creative we are, the easier it is to lose the thread that guides us. 

Our imagination is dangerous when it runs wild. How can we accurately predict the future or intepret events? How can we stay hungry and aware? Living clearly and presently takes courage. 

## The danger of early pride
> A proud man is always looking down on things and people; as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.

Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and connection with their fellow man. Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships are dulled by pride.

The question to ask when you feel pride is this. What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see. Just beause you are quiet doesn't you are without pride. We are still striving, and it is the strivers who should be our peers, not the proud and accomplished.

Don't boast, there's nothing in it for you.

## Work
> A poet's function... is not to experience the poetic state: that is a private affair. His function is to create it in others. 

> The hard thing isn't setting a big, hairy, audacious goal. The hard thing is laying people off when you miss the big goal... The hard thing isn't dreaming big. The hard thing is waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat when the dream turns into a nightmare. 

When you are not practicing, someone is. Eventually someone will show up and test you. You'll be tested and found out.
