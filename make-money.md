# Make money

Money in is business. Money out is bullshit. Make money first. It's not a business until someone pays you.
(advertise + advertisements and get orders before thinking about spending money)
SPEED:
Not prioritizing fulfillment.

if you look good and are strong people respect your hustle. 

Resell to the people you already sold to.

Don't get legal before you get rich. Money in before shits.

Don't compete on price. Where you price point lies says a lot about you. Sell it as high as possible. 

## Attention
Find a way to get attention. Anything it takes to get attention. We live in an attention economy. 

Sell people what they want. Play on people's insecurities.

If you're a loser. And you roll with losers, you're going to stay a loser.

## Secret sauce
Send people their money back.

You have to hard close people. False urgency. 
Bussiness ain't real until they pay. 
You need to high stress tolerance as a hustler. You have to be able to ride the waves. 

Don't rely on contracts. It doesn't mean anything until you enforce it.

Every purchase is an impulse purchase.

Promise your client a future.Presume the future all the time.

Have a nice image of yourself. Be presentable.

Talking is something you need to get good at.Don't fucking stutter. Free flowing.

Everything will go wrong all the time, counteracts by speed.
