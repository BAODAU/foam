# How to be miserable

## Cultivate and treasure toxic relationships

### Let impulses guide you
Most things that will elevate your mood bring little anticipatory desire: 
- exercise
- eating healthy food 
- getting to bed on timesreturn friends' messages.save fore retirement
- do your taxes

The things that we feel tempted to do are often those that make us feel worse in the long run turn on the TV, drink more, sit at home, spend impulsively, head to the casino, surf the Internet aimlessly, get into relationships or sexual encounters that you and everyone else can see are bad ideas. 

As you place a collar around our neck and hand the leash to your temptations, they will grow in power.

### Look out for number one
IF you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion. 

### Duty first, Life later
