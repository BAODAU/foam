# Objections

Types:
- not the right prospect
- no trust
- they don't see the value

## Mindset
An objection is not a rejection. It's a request for more.
Sometimes objections are tests for your confidence in your products.

> "Can we just skip to how much it costs?"

Of course I can give you my price right now. As our service is completely bespoke, it makes sense for me to have a clear idea of where your business is so we could offer you our marketing services so we could get to your target sales. (make this more light-hearted) A doctor wouldn't give his patients prescriptions before knowing all the symptoms, would he? 

> I don't want to give you our revenue figures. 

> What's your previous experience. How do I know that you can get me ROI?

> What's your agency network?

> Do you have a guarantee?

> What are your terms/ how long am I locked in for?

> How can I track results?

WE have full transparency with all of our clients so we can send detailed reports every month?

> We tried this before with someone else and it didn't work?

I completely understand how you feel. This is something we've come across before and it's very frustrating to have poor marketers tarnish the views of companies with such clear potential.

What specific outcome would you need to see to make this completely worth the investment? What would make this a no brainer to you?

We are a result-driven agency so we could fulfill your ask?

> Now not's a good time for use

Ok so when will be a good time to work on increasing your revenue? How much longer do you want to stay in your current position?

## I need to check with partner or someone else

Would you like me to jump on a call with the 2 of you? When on phone don't re-pitch, just ask "What questions do you have about us helping your business grow?"

>"Yes"
(Get a time)
I've already got you on X, reach out to me by X and I'll hold that incentive based price until then for you.

## Pricing
> I can't afford it/too much

(act confused) so you've shared throughout this meeting that this is exactly what you need to do to increase your revenue? So do you want to do this but can't afford it? Or is it that you don't see the value in the service?

You can't afford our service but can you really afford to stay in this bracket while your competitors are growing their revenues. There's a risk of you getting priced out in this social media channel. You wouldn't be happy staying at this point forever?

If value issue, act confused and revert back to the maths in presentation stage.

> We just don't have the money

That's why we're in this meeting in the first place, to help you make more?

What is your marketing budget currently going on?

Social media advertising has the cheapest cost per 1000 impressions of any advertising method EVER, it's also the most targeted. So you'd be saving money and reaching higher quality audiences, isn't that a no-brainer to you? (Redistribituing market budgets)
