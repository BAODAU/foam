# What Is a Man
Purpose. Passion. Persistence.

In other words, Strength, Nobility, Mastery. 

The hardest lesson to realize is that we are the creator and mastermind of our failure. Your competition is yourself. 

## What is a nice guy
Molded by convention, sculpted by reaction, altered by fear, the soft male's destiny is to crash and burn repeatedly until someone he likes does like him back.
