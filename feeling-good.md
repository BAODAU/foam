# Feeling Good
## Start by building self-esteem
Depressed patiens see themselves as deficient in the very qualities they value most highly: intelligence, achievement, popularity, attractiveness, health, and strength.

You feel defeated, defective, deserted, and deprived. Some people measure themselves by the way others look at them and by what they had achieved.

If you are depressed you may find it much harder to recognize the illogical thinking patterns which cause you to look down on yourself.

Freud believes the therapist should agree whatever the patient is. 

> The patient represents his ego to us as worthless, incapable of any achievement and morally despicable; he reproaches himself, vilifies himself and expects to be cast out and punished.... It would be equally fruitless from a scientific and therapeutic point of view to contradict a patient who brings these accusations against his ego. He must surely be right in some way [emphasis mine] and be describing something that is as it seems to him to be. Indeed we must at once confirm some of his statements without reservation. He really is as lacking in interest and incapable of love and achievement as he says [emphasis mine].... He also seems to us justified in certain other self-accusations; it is merely that he has a keener eye for the truth than other people who are not melancholic [emphasis mine]. When in his heightened self-criticism he describes himself as petty, egoistic, dishonest, lacking in independence, one whose sole aim has been to hide the weaknesses of his own nature, it may be so far as we know, that he has come pretty near to understanding himself [emphasis mine]; we only wonder why a man has to be ill before he can be accessible to truth of this kind.

### Achievement
You cannot earn worth through what you do. Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness. Self-worth based on accomplishments is a 'pseudo-esteem.' The great majority of depressed people are loved because self-love and self-esteem are missing. At the bottom line, only your own sense of self-worth determines how you feel.

Solve this by looking for fallacies when you are critical with yourself. In the absence of mental distortion, you cannot experience low self-worth or depression.

Some psychotherapists may allow you to ventilate these feelings of inadequacy during a therapy session. The carthatic release may sometimes result in a temporary mood elevation. 


## Self-esteem
### Talk back to your internal critic
1. Train yourself to recognize and write down self-critical thoughts as they go through your mind
2. learn why these thoughts are distorted
3. practice talking back to them to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system

### Mental biofeedback
Count the occurences of destructive/unproductive negative self-talk
At first the counter will go up. Then it plateaus and goes down. 
### Cope, don't mope
When sad, our thought patterns can easily turn into the extremes. You can tell yourself you are inherently inadequate or just plain 'no good.' If you believe those destructive thoughts, you will experience a severe emotional reaction of despaire and self-hatred. You will become inactive and paralyzed, afraid and unwilling to participate in the normal flow of life.

**First step:** stop telling yourself you are worthless bro. You must first consider that a human life is an ongoing process that involves a constantly changing physical body along with rapidly changing thoughts, feelings and behaviors. 

**You are not a thing.** Attaching labels to yourself prevent you from breaking out of that label if that label doesn't help with your personal growth.

> But I feel worthless. Therefore I must be worthless. 

Stop right this instance, your first mistake is emotional reasoning. Your feelings do not determine your worth, simply your relative state of comfort or discomfort. 

Do these when you are upset:
1. Write those negative thoughts down. 
2. Understand 10 negative thought distortions. Learn precisely how you are twisting things and blowing them out of proportion.
3. Substitute unproductive/obtrusive thought with more realistic thought patterns that not only represent reality better, but help you improve.

## Do-nothingism lmao the fuck
> A person who think all the time has nothing to think about but thoughts 

One of the most destructive aspects of depression is the way it paralyzes your willpower. In its mildest form you simply procrastinate about doing a few odious chors. Some people naturally throw themselves into life with great zest, while others mope, hang back, subconsciously defeat themselves at every turn.

If a person were condemned to spend months in isolation, cut off from all normal activities and interpersonal relationship, they will **literally turn retarded**

## Mindsets associated with procrastination and do-nothingism
### Hopelessness
You get so frozen in the pain of the present moment that you forget that you felt better in the past and find it inconceivable that you will feel more positive in the future.


### Helplessness
You are convinced that your moods are caused by factors beyond your control. Like fate, hormone cycles, dietary factors, luck, and other people's evaluation of you.
### Overwhelming yourself
You magnify a task to degree that it seems impossible to tackle. You may assume you must do everything at once instead of breaking each job down into small, discrete, manageable chunks.
### Jumpting to conclusions
You tell yourself doing things won't make you happy. You gotta test these assumption. 
### Self-labeling
The more you procrastinate, the more you attach that label to yourself. The problem compound as you enter this negative feedback loop.
### Undervaluing the rewards
You feel the reward simply won't worth the effort. *Ahedonia* is the name for a diminished ability to experience satisfaction and pleasure. 
### Perfectionism
You defeat yourself with inappropriate goals and standards.You will settle for nothing short of a magnificient performance in anything you do. So you frequently end up having to settle for just that - nothing. 
### Fear of failure
You imagine that putting in the effort and not succeeding will be an overwhelming personal defeat, you refuse to try at all. 

Many thinking errors are involved in the fear of failure. One of the most common is overgeneralization. 

You reason that 'If I fail at this, it means I will fail at anything.' Nobody can fail at everthing. 

A second mind-set that contributes to the fear of defeat is when you evaluate your performance on the outcome regardless of your individual effort.

If you admit to yourself that all you can control is the input to the process and accept that the outcome (while can be affected by effort) also depends on many factors. 
### Fear of success
Because of your lack of confidence, success may seem more risky than failure because you are certain it is based on chance. You may also fear success because you anticipate that people will make greater demands of you. 
### Fear of disapproval/ criticism
You imagine that if you try something new and fail people you care about will disapprove and won't accept you. The risk of rejection seems so dangerous.
### Coercion and resentment
You feel under intense pressure to perform. You tell yourself you have to do this or you should be doing this. You feel like  delinquent child under the discipline of a tyrannical probation officer. Every task becomes colored with such unpleasantness that you can't stand to face it. 
### Low frustration Tolerance
You assume that you should be able to solve your problems and reach your goals rapidly and easily. So you go into a frenzied state of panic when you **fucked up** or when **life prepares obstacles for you to fuck up.** 

This is the "entitlement syndrome," because you act as if you were entitled to success, love, approval, perfect health, happiness, etc.
### Guilt and Self-blame 
Stuck in a negative self-talk loop, you will naturally feel unmotivated. You hold yourself accountable for things outside of your control. Any meaningful activity has a decent chance of brightening your mood. The sense of mastery you will experience will disprove many of the distorted thoughts that slowed you down in the first place.

## Exercises
Record each time slot with what you did during the day and mark them down with M (for mastery) and P (for pleasure). Mastery activities are those which represent some accomplishments. 

Assign a score, from 0 to 5, of how you feel about the task you did retrospectively. If you adhere to schedule, you will find your motivation increasing. 

This can be helpful for a common syndrome called 'weekend/holiday blues.' This is a pattern of depression in people who are single and have their greatest emotional difficulties when alone. You assume these periods are bound to be unbearable, so you do very little to care for yourself creatively. You stare at the walls and mope, or lie in bed all day Saturday and Sunday. Or you watch a boring TV show and eat a meager dinner of peanut-butter sandwich and a cup of instant coffee. Not only you are depressed and alone but treat yourself in a way that can only inflict pain.

You may resist this by saying, "What's the point if I'm alone." Why assume you are bound to be miserable. If you are willing to care for yourself, you may notice that others will act more interested in you as well. 

At the end of the day before going to bed, write down what you actually did each hour and rate each activity for Mastery and Pleasure. 

**Little steps for little feet:** learn to break any proposed task down into its component parts. 

**Motivation without coercion** 

**Test your can'ts** you think you can't do something every time you think of something productive to do. They will sour your relationships with those you love because they will see your negative statements as annoying whining. 

**The "can't lose" system ** you may feel hesitant to put your cant's to the test because you don't want to run the risk of failure. Behind your aloofness and lack of commitment lurks a powerful sense of inadequacy and fear of failure.

A way to solve this is to identify your assumption and challenge it.

Action begets motivation begets more action.

## Verbal Judo.
Depressive episodes are set in motion by external criticism. Only one person in this world has the power to put you down: yourself. You fear criticism because you feel you need the love and approval of other people in order to be worthwhile and happy. You'll have to devote your energies trying to please people, and you won't have much left for creative, productive living. Many people find you less interesting and desirable than your self-assured friends. 

What do when someone attacks you.
### Empathy:
If the person attacks you with vague, insulting labels, ask them what the fuck they meant. 

### Disarming the critic
If you defend yourself, the criticism will come at you in a more hostile way.  

### Feedback and negotiation
Explain your position and emotions tactfully and assertively. Express your POV with an acknowldgement that you might be wrong. 

Depression is anger turned inward. He believed depressed individuals direct their rage against themselves. This is a false issue. The crucial point is not whether or not you express your feelings, but the manner in which you do it. While your angry outburst feels good momentarily, you may defeat yourself in the long run by burning bridges. You have polarized the situation prematurely and unnecessarily, and eliminated your chance to learn what the critic was trying to convey. You may experience a depressive backlash and punish yourslef inordinately for your burst of temper. 

# Defeat guilt 
If you did make a mistake and act in a hurtful way, your guilt won't reverse your blunder in some magical manner. It won't speed your learning processes to reduce the chance you'll make the same mistake in the future. Other popele won't love and respect you more because you are feeling guilty and putting yourself down in this manner.
