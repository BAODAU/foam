# Charisma
Being charismatic means making others feel at ease, comforable, and good about themselves when they are around us. s
## Presence
Focus on my environment for sound. Focus on your breath and the sensations it creates in my nostrils or stomach as it goes in and out. Focus on my toes as it forces my mind to sweep through my body.

The problem? Our society encourages distractions. The constant influx of stimulation we receive worsens our natural tendencies. This can lead us into a state of *continuous partial attention.*] We're always partially distracted. 

Check whether you mind is fully engaged constantly in a conversation or is it wandering elsewhere. 

Being charismatic depends on how fully you are in each interaction. The ability to be fully present makes you stand out from the crowd. Increasing your ability to be present improves your body language, listening skills, and mental focus. 
### Eyes
Profound eye contact can have a powerful impact on people. It can communicate empathy and give an impression of thoughtfulness, wisdom, and intelligence.

When you stare at someone intensely, you can make them release a hormone that is called love at first sight. 

Eyes are the most expressive part of the face. 

### Common mistakes with eye contact 
Lack of eye contact due to shyness and lack of eye contact due to distractions. 

Charismatic eye contact means switching to a softer focus. 

## Power and Warmth
They are the two dimension we avaluate first and foremost in assessing other people. 


Being seen as powerful means being perceived as able to affect the world around us. We look for clues of power in someone's appearance, in others' reaction to this person and in the person's body language. 

Warmth is goodwill toward others. Being seen as warm means being perceived as any of the following: benevolent, altruistic, caring, or willing to impact our world in a positive way. 

We instinctively look for clues to evaluate warmth or power. Clothes: wealth, friendly body language: good intentions, confident posture leads us to assume the person has something to be confident about. 

People will tend to accept whatever you project. 

Increasing your projection of power + warmth: maximize charisma potential. 

Charismatic behaviors must originate in your mind.  

When people try to hide their real feelings, they provoke a threat-response arousal in others. 

Most of us tend to interpret events as relating to us. 

### Physical discomfort
Counteract by 
1. Prevent
2. Recognize
3. Remedy or explain

As much as you can, plan ahead to ensure you're physically comfortable. When you're choosing a location for a meeting, take comfort into consideration. Signs of fatigue can easily show up in people's body language as lack of enthusiasm. 

Ideally, you should wear clothing makes you feel both comforable and highly confident in your appearance.

Awareness is the second step in dealing with physical discomfort. The more present you are, the better your chances of noticing if your body language is showing tension. 

If there's tension in your face, do something about it. Before others misinterpret it, try to remedy both the discomfort as well as the misinterpretation. 

Mental discomfort can result from anxiety, dissastisfaction, self-criticism, or self-doubt. Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs. It can cause us to make premature decisions. Anxiety, low presence, and low confidence can show up directly in our body language, and it reduces our ability to emanate warmth. 

Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again. 

### Alleviate discomfort of uncertainty
Responsibility transfer. 
Our brains are wired first to understand, then to believe, and last to disbelieve. 

### Self-criticism
Internal critical voice attacks you with self-doubt, bringing up memories of past failures, past humiliations, and indequacies. The human body shoots adrenaline and cortisol through its veins. 

Self-criticism is the most common obstacles to great performance in any field. Some people are subsumed in negativity. 

Aim to stay aware of any physical sensation or discomfort. If physical discomfort arises, act promptly to alleviate or explain it. 

## Overcome obstacles
### Step one: Destimatize discomfort
Understand that it's nomal to be feel internal discomfort. Shame is the real killer. Of all the emotions that human beings can feel, it is one of the most toxic to health and happiness. Shame researcher Brene Brown defines it as 'the fear of being unlovable. Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging.' 

Shame hits us so powerfully because it conveys a message about our fundamental acceptability as human beings. If the tribe rejects you, you die. The brain equates social needs with survival: being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses. Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we'd be excluded by those who matter to our survival. 

Shame is easily triggered and fast to escalate. It's not what we feel is the most painful: it's our shame about feeling this way that really does the damage. 

1. Remember that uncomfortable emotions are normal.
2. Dedramatize. Common part of human experience
3. Think of admirable people who've gone through this before
4. See it as one burden shared by many. 

### Neutralize negativity.
Even when it seems that someone is reacting negatively. What we're seeing in their face might have nothing to do with us. 

Train yourself to recognize that negative reactions from my opponent could be reflections of their internal turmoil. 

# Posture 
Low-status reassuring posture like fidgeting, nodding, saying uhmm a lot can stem from 2 reasons. 
1. Empathy: want to ensure the other person feels heard and broadcast that you are paying attention.
2. Insecurity: wanting to appease the person you are interacting with. 

People who are high-status are more contained. They don't have the urge to give reassurance because they don't give a shit what their counterpart is thinking. 

Verbal reassurance like saying hmmm or saying 'Oh, I agree' is absolutely not cool. It should be done as consciously as possible. Try to replace it with stillness and silence. Aim to get comfortable with your silence, even inserting between sentences or midsentences. 

When you want to be seen as confident, limit your reassuring behavior.
