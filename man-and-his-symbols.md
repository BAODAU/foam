# Man and his symbols
Dreams are our subconscious minds' way of telling ourselves what we don't know about ourselves.

There is an idea that 'every man carries a woman within himself.' It is this female element in every male that Jung called the 'anima.' 

- Misoneism: a deep and superstitious fear of novelty. Many pionners in philosophy, science, and even literature have been victims of the innate conservatism of their contemporaries.

Psychology attempts to deal with the working of the unconscious. 

If you observe the behavior of a neurotic person, you can see him doing many things that he appears to be doing consciously and purposefully. Yet if you ask him about them, you will discover that he is unconscious.

The physician can see this process quite clearly when he hypnotizes a neurotic patient. Under hypnosis, they are very much aware of their experience. 

in our conscious life, other people stimulate or depress us. Events at the office or in our social life distract us. Such things seduce us into following ways that are unsuitable to our individuality. Whether or not we are aware of the effect they have on our consciousness. It is disturbed by and exposed to them almost wihtout defense. This is especially the case with a person whose extraverted attitude of mind lays all the empasis upon external objects, or who harbors feelings of inferiority and doubt concerning his own innermost personality. The more that consciousness is influenced by prejudices, errors, fantasis, and infantile wishes, the mor ethe already existing gap will widen into a neurotic dissociation and lead to a more or less artificial life far removed from healthy instincts, nature, and truth.

The general function of dreams is to try to restore our psychological balance by producing dream material that re-establishes, in a subtle way, the total psychic equilibrium. It explains why people who have unrealistic ideas or too high an opinion of themselves, or who make grandiose plans out of proportion to their real capacities, have dreams of flying or falling. The dream compensates for the deviciencies of their personalities, and at the same time it warns them of the dangers in their present course. If the warnings of the dreams are disregarded, real accidents may take their place. The victim may fall downstairs or may have a motor accident. 

One cannot afford to be naive in dealing with dreams. They originate in a spirit that is not quite human, but is rather a breath of nature - a spirit of the beautiful and generous as well as the cruel goddess. 

> I had always bee nimpressed by the fact that there are a surprising number of individuals who never use their minds if they can avoid itm and an equal number who do use their minds, but in an amazingly stupid way. I was also surprised to find many intelligent and wide-awake people who lived as if they had never leanred to use their sense organs: They did not see the things before their eyes, hear the words sounding in their ears, or notice the things they touced or tasted. Some lived without being aware of the state of their own bodies.
