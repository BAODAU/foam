# People
This is what someone on the internet has to say about people. 

People are kids pretending to be mature. 
Humility is the strongest shoeld agianst anyone who would try to manipulate, hurt or make you unhappy. 
Knowledge is overrated, acting is underrated. 
That's why so many 'thinkers' are underachievers and successful people seem ignorant/ 

You must live for yourself. The goal of your life is to be happy, never lose perspective: 

It's not a fault to fail, but is is to aim low. Nobody wants you to succeed. Do not trust anyone except yourself. Do not imitate anyone, be original. 

People trying to be normal end up unhappy because they aren't living their lives. To be happy, you should do otherwise. 

Becoming who you want to be is the greaest joy in life. Becoming a clone of someone else and acting like women expect you to doesn't grant you happiness. 



You make who you are. The bad and the good. Everyone is a reflection of you. The only answer to live a full and happy life is to prepare yourself for everything you want.
