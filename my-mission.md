# My mission
My mission for the next 90 days is to build an advertising business. On top of that I will build developed and muscular arms, chest, back, glutes, and legs. I will go to the gym consistently (following a PPL routine) and follow a proper diet.  

Intellectually, I will read a mixture of self-help, math/CS, business, and philosophy books. It doesn't really matter to me which I will read in a particular day. What matters is I'll spend at least 2 hours a day reading (in a laborious way). 

I will also make my surrounding environment pristine, beautiful, and inspiring. I will spend at most 30 minutes a day doing that. 

I will also force myself to talk to a new person everyday irregardless of how inconvenient it is. 

I WILL NOT MASTURBATE. I WILL NOT WATCH mind-numbing shows on yt, tiktok, netflix.

I will always go out with a proper outfit. 


build an (advertising) business: I want to build a money-making machine. I want to be free from the banking system. Not only in a spiritual way, but also financially well-off to buy anything that anyone could sell to me if I shall choose. I want this for myself. 

I will read a mixture of self-help, math/CS, business, and philosophy books:
I am aware that my wants and needs might be socially programmed and/or artificially implanted on me by other entities. Reading philosophy books is a hedge against that probability by exposing me to the thinking process of geniuses who have figured it out. Of course there is a real threat of my thinking being imposed by those smart people, and not for my own good. I recognize this is a real battle worth fighting for. In the event of those people being benevolent enough to do it to educate, I can learn and grow. 
Math/CS: I'm convinced I will need this in order to filter out actual high-level smart people among posers in tech.
Self-help: help me with blindspots in my thinking.


## Exercise: Where Do My Wants Come From?
**Write down the things you want out of yourself over the next 10 years**
I want to have a base in every major city in the world. I want to have at least 2 major superpower passports. I want to align myself into the kind of work that expands my own financial empire. aka I want to dominate an entire sector and expand to others. I want to have a lifestyle whose rules and regulations are self-imposed. 

Why do I want a base in every major city? I believe my genes are worthy of being passed down.
