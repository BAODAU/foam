# Flow


Flow is a state of self-forgetfulness, the opposite of rumination and worry: instead of being lost in nervous preoccupation, people in flow are so absorbed in the task at hand that they lose all self-consciousness. In this state you are egoless. People in flow exhibit a masterly control of what they are doing. Theyr responses are perfectly attuned to the changing demands of the task. 

High achievers find pleasures and flow in studying. The low achievers fail to hone the skills that would get them in flow, forfeit the enjoyment of study and run the risk of limiting the level of intellectual tasks that will be enjoyable to them in the future.
