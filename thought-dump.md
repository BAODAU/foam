I do believe I am suffering from the Peter Pan syndrome to a various degree. To solve this I must learn the thought patterns behind my actions. 

After doing nofap for two days I realized how much the porn-watcher ego is bullying me inside. 

I also realized how much of an asshole I was that I didn't get the love I wanted from my female friends.
