# Live Cold Session

The reason why people don't do deals with you is because they don't trust you.

Must stay calm. 

Takes 

## Objections/Deferral 
### Email
They make you send an email. 

>"Awesome! Who should I address in the email?"

### Take phone numbers

## Acceptance

## Lead sourcing
Try to get pass the gatekeepers and straight to the owners. 

Don't have to be high energy to do this. Don't be a clown. 

Make them validate the objections.
