# Asset allocation
The process of dividing investment porfolio among different assets: [[stock]], [[bond]], and [[cash]]. 

The asset allocation that works best depend largely on the need, ability and willingness of the investor to take risk. 

## Goal
Help investors reduce the risk inherent in volatile equity asset classes that are expected to provide higher returns by combining these asset classes with more stable fixed-income assets. 

To select an asset allocation that lets you sleep at night, and avoid the urge to sell out in a panic. A tactical asset allocation shifts allocations 

## Impact on risk and returns
>  In short, during the next 20 or 30 years, there will be a single, best allocation that in retrospect we will have wished we have owned. The only problem is that we haven't a clue what that portfolio will be. So, the safest course is to own as many asset classes as you can; that way you can be sure of avoiding the catastrophe of holding a portfolio concentrated in the worst ones.

>  We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the investor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his funds in common stocks, with a consequence inverse range of 75% to 25% in bonds. There is an implication here that the standard division should be an equal one, or 50-50, between the two major investment mediums.
